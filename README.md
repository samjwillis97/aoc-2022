# 🎄 Advent of Code 2022

---

## Usage

### Scaffold a day

```sh
# example: `cargo scaffold 1`
cargo scaffold <day>

# output:
# Created module "src/bin/01.rs"
# Created empty input file "src/inputs/01.txt"
# Created empty example file "src/examples/01.txt"
# ---
# 🎄 Type `cargo solve 01` to run your solution.
```

Individual solutions live in the `./src/bin/` directory as separate binaries.

Every [solution](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust/blob/main/src/bin/scaffold.rs#L11-L41) has _unit tests_ referencing its _example_ file. Use these unit tests to develop and debug your solution against the example input. For some puzzles, it might be easier to forgo the example file and hardcode inputs into the tests.

When editing a solution, `rust-analyzer` will display buttons for running / debugging unit tests above the unit test blocks.

### Download input for a day

> **Note**  
> This command requires [installing the aoc-cli crate](#download-puzzle-inputs-via-aoc-cli).

```sh
# example: `cargo download 1`
cargo download <day>

# output:
# Downloading input with aoc-cli...
# Loaded session cookie from "/home/felix/.adventofcode.session".
# Downloading input for day 1, 2021...
# Saving puzzle input to "/tmp/tmp.MBdcAdL9Iw/input"...
# Done!
# ---
# 🎄 Successfully wrote input to "src/inputs/01.txt"!
```

To download inputs for previous years, append the `--year/-y` flag. _(example: `cargo download 1 --year 2020`)_

Puzzle inputs are not checked into git. [Reasoning](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k99rod/sharing_input_data_were_we_requested_not_to/gf2ukkf/?context=3).

### Run solutions for a day

```sh
# example: `cargo solve 01`
cargo solve <day>

# output:
#     Running `target/debug/01`
# 🎄 Part 1 🎄
#
# 6 (elapsed: 37.03µs)
#
# 🎄 Part 2 🎄
#
# 9 (elapsed: 33.18µs)
```

`solve` is an alias for `cargo run --bin`. To run an optimized version for benchmarking, append the `--release` flag.

Displayed _timings_ show the raw execution time of your solution without overhead (e.g. file reads).

### Run all solutions

```sh
cargo all

# output:
#     Running `target/release/advent_of_code`
# ----------
# | Day 01 |
# ----------
# 🎄 Part 1 🎄
#
# 0 (elapsed: 170.00µs)
#
# 🎄 Part 2 🎄
#
# 0 (elapsed: 30.00µs)
# <...other days...>
# Total: 0.20ms
```

`all` is an alias for `cargo run`. To run an optimized version for benchmarking, use the `--release` flag.

_Total timing_ is computed from individual solution _timings_ and excludes as much overhead as possible.

### Run all solutions against the example input

```sh
cargo test
```

### Format code

```sh
cargo fmt
```

### Lint code

```sh
cargo clippy
```

## Template setup

This template supports all major OS (macOS, Linux, Windows).

### Create your repository 📝

1.  Open [the template repository](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust) on Github.
2.  Click [Use this template](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust/generate) and create your repository.
3.  Clone your repository to your computer.

### Setup rust 💻

1.  Install the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  (recommended) Install the [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html) extension for your code editor.
3.  (optional) Install a native debugger. If you are using VS Code, [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) is a good option.

✨ You can start solving puzzles now! Head to the [Usage section](#usage) to see how to use this template. If you like, you can configure [some optional features](#optional-template-features).

## Optional template features

### Download puzzle inputs via aoc-cli

1. Install [`aoc-cli`](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli/) via cargo: `cargo install aoc-cli --version 0.5.0`.
2. Create an `.adventofcode.session` file in your home directory and paste your session cookie[^1] into it. To get this, press F12 anywhere on the Advent of Code website to open your browser developer tools. Look in your Cookies under the Application or Storage tab, and copy out the `session` cookie value.

Once installed, you can use the [download command](#download-input-for-a-day).

### Enable clippy lints in CI

Uncomment the `clippy` job in the `ci.yml` workflow to enable clippy checks in CI.

## Useful crates

-   [itertools](https://crates.io/crates/itertools): Extends iterators with extra methods and adaptors. Frequently useful for aoc puzzles.
-   [regex](https://crates.io/crates/regex): Official regular expressions implementation for Rust.

A curated list of popular crates can be found on [blessred.rs](https://blessed.rs/crates).

## Common pitfalls

-   **Integer overflows:** This template uses 32-bit integers by default because it is generally faster - for example when packed in large arrays or structs - than using 64-bit integers everywhere. For some problems, solutions for real input might exceed 32-bit integer space. While this is checked and panics in `debug` mode, integers [wrap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-overflow) in `release` mode, leading to wrong output when running your solution.
